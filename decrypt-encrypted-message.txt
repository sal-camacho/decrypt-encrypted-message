Step 1:  Read the contents of a file

# Use the ls command to list the files in the current working directory.
analyst@163ee689c1ab:~$ ls /home/analyst
Q1.encrypted  README.txt  caesar

# Use the cat command to list the contents of the README.txt file.
analyst@163ee689c1ab:~$ cat README.txt
Hello,
All of your data has been encrypted. To recover your data, you will need to solve a cipher. To get started look for a hidden file in the caesar subdirectory.

Step 2: Find a hidden file

# Use the cd command to change to the caesar subdirectory of your home directory
analyst@163ee689c1ab:~$ cd caesar
analyst@163ee689c1ab:~/caesar$ 

# Use the ls -a command to list all files, including hidden files, in your home directory.
analyst@163ee689c1ab:~/caesar$ ls -a
.  ..  .leftShift3

# Use the cat command to list the contents of the .leftShift3 file.
analyst@163ee689c1ab:~/caesar$ cat .leftShift3
Lq rughu wr uhfryhu brxu ilohv brx zloo qhhg wr hqwhu wkh iroorzlqj frppdqg:

rshqvvo dhv-256-fef -sengi2 -d -g -lq T1.hqfubswhg -rxw T1.uhfryhuhg -n hwwxeuxwh

# You can decrypt the Caesar cipher in the .leftshift3 file by using the following command
analyst@163ee689c1ab:~/caesar$ cat .leftShift3 | tr "d-za-cD-ZA-C" "a-zA-Z"
In order to recover your files you will need to enter the following command:

openssl aes-256-cbc -pbkdf2 -a -d -in Q1.encrypted -out Q1.recovered -k ettubrute

# Return to your home directory before completing the next task
analyst@163ee689c1ab:~/caesar$ cd ~
analyst@163ee689c1ab:~$ 

Step 3: Decrypt a file

# Use the exact command revealed in the previous task to decrypt the encrypted file
analyst@163ee689c1ab:~$ openssl aes-256-cbc -pbkdf2 -a -d -in Q1.encrypted -out Q1.recovered -k ettubrute
analyst@163ee689c1ab:~$

# Use the ls command to list the contents of your current working directory again.
analyst@163ee689c1ab:~$ ls 
Q1.encrypted  Q1.recovered  README.txt  caesar

# Use the cat command to list the contents of the Q1.recovered file.
analyst@163ee689c1ab:~$ cat Q1.recovered
If you are able to read this, then you have successfully decrypted the classic cipher text. You recovered the encryption key that was used to encrypt this file. Great work!
